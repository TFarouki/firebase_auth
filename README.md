# firebase_auth

Flutter app with firebase as backend signin and signup (login and regesteration) based on my last project (auth UI flutter)

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few ideas to make on this project :
- registre new user
- login
- home with menu drawr
- profile
  * show profile
  * edit profile
-log out
